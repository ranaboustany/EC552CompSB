'main.py' is the file usued to run the algorithm.  
  
Before running the file, you must download the following two csv files form this repository:   
    - gateLibrary.csv (contains the library of gates that can be used in your design)  
    - inputSignalLibrary.csv (contains the library of external input signals to be used)  
IMPORTANT: Make sure they are in the same directory as the main.py file.  
  
Once your directory is set up, you can run the python script using a Python version of 3.7.6 or above.
