Homework 1: Genetic Circuit Design  
by Rana Boustany and Angela Abrego Chavez  
  
'main.py' is the file usued to run the algorithm.  
  
Before running the file, you must download the following two csv files form this repository:   
     1 - gateLibrary.csv (contains the library of gates that can be used in your design)  
     2 - inputSignalLibrary.csv (contains the library of external input signals to be used)  
IMPORTANT: Make sure they are in the same directory as the main.py file.  
  
Once your directory is set up, you can run the python script using a Python version of 3.7.6 or above.

When run, the python algorithm will display an introduction and the rules of the program. It will also tell you exactly what you should do next at specifict timepoints. Please make sure to respect the rules and follow what is asked of you to ensure a smooth experience!  
  
    
Note:  
When you will design a circuit, a csv file will be saved to your working directory under the name of "design.csv". This file will contain the design of your latest designed circuit.     
When you ask to see your results, a csv file will be saved to your working directory under the name of "history.csv". This file will contain the summary of your results.  
It is important not to delete or move these files when the algorithm runs as they must be in the same directory.
